                            Discussion and the exchange of ideas are essential to academic work. For assignments in this course, you are encouraged to consult with your classmates on the choice of paper topics and to share sources. You may find it useful to discuss your chosen topic with your peers, particularly if you are working on the same topic as a classmate. However, you should ensure that any written work you submit for evaluation is the result of your own research and writing and that it reflects your own approach to the topic. You must also adhere to standard citation practices in this discipline and properly cite any books, articles, websites, lectures, etc. that have helped you with your work. If you received any help with your writing (feedback on drafts, etc), you must also acknowledge this assistance.

<!-- Note 3: Instead of implementing the link for "Edit Written Work Template" as a a submittable form, I implemented it as a button wrapped in an <a> tag. Kindly see Note 4. It made integration into the rest of the project much easier. Maybe this is why the icons got displaced downwards? Either way, is it possible to work with my replacement as laid out in Note 4? -->

<!-- Note 4: The "Edit Written Work Template" link implemented as an <a> tag that wraps around a simple button for easy integration. Don't worry about how the data is sent to the server once a user clicks the button. I took care of that with Django. Django can handle it via the 'href' attribute so no worries. -->

For assignments in this course, you are encouraged to consult with your classmates as you work on problem sets. However, after discussions with peers, make sure that you can work through the problem yourself and ensure that any answers you submit for evaluation are the result of your own efforts. In addition, you must cite any books, articles, websites, lectures, etc that have helped you with your work using appropriate citation practices. Similarly, you must list the names of students with whom you have collaborated on problem sets.
